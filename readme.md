NLP-Powered Notes and Task Manager

## Overview

This project is a powerful note-taking and task management application that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide:

- **Full NLP-Powered Text Search**: Search notes using natural language queries, including fuzzy search, synonym detection, and contextual results.
- **Task Scheduling Integration**: Convert notes into tasks or reminders automatically.
- **Website Builder from Notes**: One-click transformation of notes into responsive, SEO-friendly websites.
- **Internal Documentation Generator**: Auto-organize notes into team documentation.
- **Real-Time Collaboration and Team Spaces**: Enable collaborative note-taking and task management.
- **Smart Workflow Automation**: Automate workflows based on detected text patterns.
- **Voice and Video Note Support**: Record audio or video directly in a note.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript Compiler
- **Database**: (To be specified based on implementation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezecodes/notalx.git
cd notalx
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your PC. You can download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

After installing PostgreSQL, you need to set up the database schema. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   createdb notalx_db
   ```

2. Configure your database connection in the `.env` file:

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=notalx_db
   DB_USER=your_postgres_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   ```

3. Uncomment the sync command in the `sequelize.ts` file inside the `src` folder to seed the schema:

   ```typescript
   // src/sequelize.ts
   import { Sequelize } from "sequelize";

   const sequelize = new Sequelize(
     process.env.DB_NAME,
     process.env.DB_USER,
     process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
     {
       host: process.env.DB_HOST,
       dialect: "postgres",
     }
   );

   // Uncomment the following line to sync the schema
   // sequelize.sync({ force: true });

   export default sequelize;
   ```

4. Run the development server to apply the schema:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will set up the PostgreSQL database and apply the necessary schema for the application.

This will start both the React frontend and the Node.js backend simultaneously.

## Available Scripts

- **Start the production server**:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Run the development server**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Build the project**:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Build individual components**:

  - Build frontend: `npm run build:client`
  - Build backend: `npm run build:server`
  - Build CSS: `npm run build:css`

- **Watch changes in development**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev:client  # Start frontend in watch mode
  npm run dev:server  # Start backend in watch mode
  npm run dev:css     # Watch CSS changes
  ```

## Deployment

You can deploy the generated website to [Render](render.com), or a custom domain by exporting the build output.
