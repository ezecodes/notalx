Real-World Impact: A medical researcher’s casual note on treatment techniques could inspire breakthroughs when made public.
For Example: A developer sharing a note on debugging tips might find new collaborators or mentees.

Rules on task and notes

As a note owner, I can add collaborators to my note,
collaborators can view, edit, use AI features(summerise, schedule tasks) on shared note
Only tasks created by current authenticated user will be shown on a note


To view a hidden note, you must either be authenticated using the alias you used to create the note or you must enter a valid secret

While listing all notes within an alias,
You must be authenticated under that alias and authorized as the alias before hidden notes will be shown or listed
But public notes do not need any form of auth 

Authentication process of an alias:
Select the alias from the start page
Then click on the auth icon
You enter the email you used to create that alias
An OTP (One time password) is sent to the email
Once otp is verified, that alias is now authorized within that ip address and agent to view hidden notes, edit notes , change note secret

NOTE : opt and auth session lasts for 1 hour before it expires and you will have to re-auth 


Add ability to mention a user in a note, could be a collaborator or not
